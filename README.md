# CleanedIn - The LinkedIn Cleanser

 CleanedIn is a web extension designed to transform your LinkedIn experience by filtering out the "noise" from your feed, delivering a cleaner, more professional browsing experience.

## Overview

LinkedIn feeds often contain excessive emojis, corporate buzzwords, and over-the-top emotional language that can detract from valuable content. CleanedIn automatically analyzes each LinkedIn post using AI and replaces "noisy" content with cleaned, professional versions that get straight to the point.

## Features

CleanedIn intelligently filters out:

- Excessive & irrelevant emojis
- Corporate buzzwords
- Unnecessary superlatives
- Over-emotional language
- Irrelevant stories/content
- Hashtag spam

The result is a cleaner, more professional LinkedIn feed that respects your time and delivers authentic, valuable content without the fluff.


## How It Works

1. **Browse LinkedIn**
   - Open LinkedIn and scroll through your feed as you normally would
   - CleanedIn runs silently in the background, analyzing each post

2. **AI Processing & Detection**
   - When CleanedIn detects a post, it instantly processes the content to make necessary changes

3. **Clean Content Replacement**
   - The original post is replaced with a clean, professional version
   - The core message remains intact, but all the fluff is gone
   - A small button on the draggable widget allows you to switch back to the original post if needed
